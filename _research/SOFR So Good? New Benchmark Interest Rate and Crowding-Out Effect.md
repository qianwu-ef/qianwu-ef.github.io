excerpt: 'I study the scarce collateral channel through which the government debt can result in an additional crowding-out effect on both asset prices and macroeconomic variables under the SOFR regime. The collateral channel suggests that a higher supply of Trea- suries reduces their scarcity value, which drives up Treasury holder’s borrowing cost on the Repo market. That is, SOFR increases. I first provide empirical evidence of an additional rise in SOFR in response to an increase in government debt. To proceed, I borrow the structure of agents’ problems and markets set up from Jermann (2019) and then incorporate a no-arbitrage condition in the spirit of Nyborg (2019). In LI- BOR economy, business coupon rate is determined by the interbank borrowing cost, while in SOFR economy, it is determined by outside no-arbitrage condition on liquidity markets. The scarce collateral channel enables public debt to affect the real economy even without distortionary taxes, although quantitative analysis shows that in general equilibrium, this effect is very small. The findings from this paper abate the worries about extra crowding-out effect from the benchmark rate transition.'

Abstract: 'I study the scarce collateral channel through which the government debt can result in an additional crowding-out effect on both asset prices and macroeconomic variables under the SOFR regime. The collateral channel suggests that a higher supply of Trea- suries reduces their scarcity value, which drives up Treasury holder’s borrowing cost on the Repo market. That is, SOFR increases. I first provide empirical evidence of an additional rise in SOFR in response to an increase in government debt. To proceed, I borrow the structure of agents’ problems and markets set up from Jermann (2019) and then incorporate a no-arbitrage condition in the spirit of Nyborg (2019). In LI- BOR economy, business coupon rate is determined by the interbank borrowing cost, while in SOFR economy, it is determined by outside no-arbitrage condition on liquidity markets. The scarce collateral channel enables public debt to affect the real economy even without distortionary taxes, although quantitative analysis shows that in general equilibrium, this effect is very small. The findings from this paper abate the worries about extra crowding-out effect from the benchmark rate transition.'
