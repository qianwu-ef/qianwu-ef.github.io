title: "A New Keynesian Preferred Habitat Model with Repo (JMP)"
category: research
permalink: /research/project1
excerpt: 'This paper documents puzzling discrepancies in the Treasury cash and repo markets during the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) and the Covid-19 pandemic. To explain these observations, I develop a New Keynesian Preferred Habitat model with repo featuring market segmentation, financial frictions, and preference shocks. The stochastic discount factor captures both financial and macroeconomic conditions. In this framework, financial market tensions can trigger real recessions, even in the absence of fundamental disruptions. The model illustrates a flight-to-liquidity demand during the GFC, and a flight-from-safety supply during the Covid-19 pandemic. The findings suggest that the effectiveness of monetary policies depends on financial frictions and the relative importance of the cash versus repo borrowing channels. Overall, this paper underscores the strong linkage between financial markets and the real economy.'
