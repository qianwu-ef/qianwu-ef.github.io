excerpt: ' We analyze the neutrality of ESG strategies with an Arrowâ€“Debreu(AD) model of general equilibrium with production, time, and uncertainty. We show that when the market is complete, because investors can always replicate the payoffs of any portfolio, the SRI is neutral if it does not affect consumption or production preference. Conversely, socially responsible consumption (SRC) and socially responsible production (SRP) are effective in allocating capital to firms with positive aggregate externalities, thereby influencing real economic outcomes.'
