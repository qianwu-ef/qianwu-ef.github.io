title: "SOFR So Good? New Benchmark Interest Rate and Crowding-Out Effect"
category: research
permalink: /research/project2
excerpt: 'This paper examines the scarce collateral channel through which government debt may create an additional crowding-out effect on asset prices and macroeconomic variables under the SOFR regime. An increased supply of Treasuries diminishes their scarcity value, leading to higher borrowing costs for Treasury holders in the repo market and an increase in the SOFR. I provide empirical evidence demonstrating that rising government debt correlates with an increase in SOFR.  I then build a stylized model where LIBOR or SOFR can index the business coupon rate. This scarce collateral channel allows public debt to impact the real economy under the SOFR regime without relying on distortionary taxes, though quantitative analysis indicates that the effect in general equilibrium is minimal.'
